# Test Anti-Patterns GT Study
This repository contains all of the coded test data and basic memos for this research.

The different tables used to gather this data have been exported into csv files. They are separated into two groups based on the projects the data was pulled from: popular GitHub projects or curated projects from *Curating github for engineered software projects*. A diagram of how these tables are put together is also included.

The memos for the data are included in the `LinguisticAntiPatternData.xlsx` spreadsheet.
